                I, Gobelet, want to give some credit to Yuki and Etoile for helping me with the color palette and proof reading the texts. 
                Furthermore, I want to give special thanks to everyone in this server for the incredible time spent with everyone, and the future time that I'll be here.
                I dont think I'll leave this server in the coming years, but even if I did, a thank you to everyone for having me here.<br>
                It's been an honor working as an admin and overal being a member, and even if there were some less fun moments before, I don't regret anything.
              </p>
