          <p id="CHbody1"> First, the suggest channel. Here, you can make suggestions on what we can do with the server or things within the server.
            There are requirements for your suggestion, though. Firstly, you must provide a thorough explanation on what your suggestion does and why we should do it.
            "Just because" or "Because I'm bored" is not a valid reason. If your suggestion involves bots, you must clearly state what the bot does,
            and what the pros and cons are. You are not allowed to chat in Suggest aside from discussing your suggestion.

            The QOTD channel can be used once a day by a person to place a question, and ping the QOTD role. The person asking the question must make a thread on their message,
            and all answers must be given there. Chatting in the channel or off-topic chatting in the threads is not allowed. COTD (comment of the day) works similarly,
            except you dont need threads to discuss.<br>
            The starboard is a place for messages with three or more :star: reactions. These are usually especially funny or interesting messages.

          <p> The roleplay channel can be used to, well, roleplay. This is the only channel where Tupperbox is allowed to be used, but keep in mind, we can still see who
            used the bot to speak. <b>This is not a discussion channel.</b><br>
            The CMD channel can be used for <i>any</i> bot command, but there are a few bot-specific channels you can use. <br>
            The spam channel is the <b>only</b> channel in the server where you can spam or send exceptionally large messages without getting timed out.<br>
            All VC channels must still follow all the rules, and staff has the right to join a VC channel regardless of permissions or room size at any point 
            if they wish to check whether or not these rules are being followed.
