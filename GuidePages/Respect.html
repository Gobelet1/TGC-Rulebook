          <p id="Rbody1">Firstly, you are to respect every member in the server. Jokes are allowed, and so is swearing, but neither should be used with the intent to offend.
            Sexism, racism, and discrimination are strictly prohibited - however, light jokes (such as "Imagine eating frogs like the French") are allowed. 
            Slurs are not tolerated, no matter the scenario or person who uses it.<br>

        <div>
          <p id="Rbody2">Secondly, harassment in any form is absolutely not allowed. As stated above, jokes are alright, and so are arguments. The thing to pay attention to, however,
            is whether you're having a proper, civil argument or if you're simply arguing for the sake of being right or similar. In the latter case, it is no longer allowed.
            In the case that harassment takes place, you <i>have</i> to stop when someone tells you to, <i>or</i> you can contact staff for help through the Support channel.
