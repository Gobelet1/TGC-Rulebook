          <p id="Pbody1"> First, pings. You are allowed to ping whoever you like, unless they tell you otherwise. Use of role pings is prohibited, 
            with the exception of the Random ping. Even then, you are not allowed to spam these pings. Use of exceptionally large role pings, such as 
            @everyone or @Genshin Impact <b>will</b> get you timed out. <br>
            @Support Staff may only be used if you are either in a ticket or if you need staff in a channel when there is none present.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Head5">
          <p id="Pbody2"> Before you DM someone, you are to check their DM role, and do as it says. If a member does not have such a role, you must ask them to DM. You are never
            to DM a staff member unless told otherwise when regarding server matters. Keep in mind, staff has the right to DM you regardless of your DM role, as they may have to
            verify or otherwise discuss things with members.<br>
            <b>Anything that happens in DMs can still be punished if a rule is broken and one or more people in the DMs report you to staff.</b> 
            You may also be reported for unauthorized DM-ing of people. Advertising through DMs is banned.
