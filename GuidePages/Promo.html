            The sharing rules encompasses things such as where to share art and media, as well as some rules regarding this.
            Firstly, all media other than art must be posted in the Media channel. Only images of art - which must be made by yourself - can be posted in the Artwork channel. <br>
            >What do I do with art that I didn't make? Answer: post it in Media, with credit if possible. <br>
            Secondly, an exception is made when using gifs or other media in a discussion, for example as reference or similar. 
            In that case you aren't required to place it in Media.

            This paragraph is all about promotion and partnerships. So, first and foremost, promotion. This is quite simple; it can only be
            done in the Self-promo channel, nowhere else. Links to platforms in a bio or status is allowed - it's not something we moderate.<br>
