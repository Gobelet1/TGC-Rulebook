          <p id="TObody1"> Discord's TOS must always be followed. This is a requirement both for us as a server and for you as a member. One of the most important rules included
            in that is that you <i>have</i> to be 13+ in order to join this server, and if we find out that's not the case, you will be kicked or banned for at least a year. 
            You are also not allowed to provide access to hacking, cracked, or stolen software as per TOS.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Head7">
          <p id="TObody2"> Every channel has a topic, as you can see by its name, and you must stick to this topic. If a discussion gradually leads you off-topic, that is okay, 
            but dont start a discussion on the wrong topic. Staff may tell you to change channel or end a topic entirely in certain cases.<br>
            English is the only allowed language in the server, for every channel, including spoken messages or voice channels.
            However, small messages in a different language are allowed under the following circumstances:<br>
            >You dont know a word in English and want to translate it to or from your language.<br>
            >You provide an English description of your message (E.G. when referencing something that doesn't exist in English).
